# App Startup	

OK, the customer has downloaded the app from Google Play or the AppStore. Upon the app startup, we need to look out for the following things: 

## Customer's Device

* Is this a device we support? Maybe the customer side loaded the app. 
* Is this an OS version we support? We need to take a stand and not support early OS versions, e.g., Android 2.2. 
* Is this device connected to the internet? Think airplane mode. 
* Does this device have a strong wifi/cell connection? 
** If we have a weak connection, do we want to notify the customer?
