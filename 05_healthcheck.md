# Health Check

Health Check means taking a continuous approach to looking at app performance, business performance, and addressing issues when they appear. 

## App Health
At minimum, teams need to have access to Google Analytics and Apple's App Analytics. Per each release, engineers need to keep an eye on app crashes and anomalies and take immediate action to address. 

A mature organization will have a tool to explore backend services and user sessions to help correlate app issues and anamolies. [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) or similar tools have been essential in this.

**Beware of UI Changes**

Infrastructure Team: "_What did you do last month? We're seeing a significant spike in on-going sessions on the server? We had to increase our spend on infrastructure by X%._" 

App Team: "_We moved the log off button to another screen._"

---

In short, there is a significant amount of complexity and coordination across teams and systems. A mature monitoring and health check system is important to flag issues and provide insight into resolution paths. Design and system changes can and will have unexpected impacts which are difficult to predict and foresee. 



## Business Health

A business centric dashboard helps fuel all employees with the knowledge that we are making a positive impact to the industry. But for an engineer, it helps point out future needs, further drives the team's directive and value, helps validate or invalidate technical and design decisions, and more.
