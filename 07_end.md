Let me know what you think. These are only a few pages, which I think can help start a conversation but it's more productive to start a dialog with questions or answers you have. 

Other topics I would like to write about: 

* **Marketing IT:** I spent a few years running an internally-built Ad Ops based platform, running on Adobe Experience Manager. I inherited this Frankenstein monster from the Business and spent a few years trying to migrate the organization to something lite, new, less expensive, etc. It was a complete failure. Marketing IT is very [disorganized](https://chiefmartec.com/2018/04/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2018/). 
* **Enterprise content management:** I spent a few years managing Chase.com's on-premise Adobe Experience Manager platform. It was very successful because of the great engineers, content partners, insight, an executive management.
