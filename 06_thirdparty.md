# Third Party

Third Party refers to pulling in content from 3rd party partners and trying to keep some sense of common branding and UX. For web sites, there are ways we can do this with some sense of security when the customer is logged in. For Native apps, we should refrain with integration with 3rd party vendors. If we need to do this, then it's preferred that we levarge 3rd party partner APIs, consume data within our own server tier, then publish data to our native apps. With this approach, we have the following benefits: 

* A better handle on security and session management. 
* Guarantee consistent look and feel. 
* Reduced risk with vendors changing services
